# PasswordStrength

This is a test repository.

It is just a small wrapper application for the nbvcxz library to see if GraalVM works with a Swing application.

## Usage

- Call `java -jar PasswordStrength.jar` to run the application (on any platform with Java 17+ installed).
- Call `./PasswordStrength` to run the application on Linux or macOS (if you have made it executable with `chmod +x PasswordStrength`).
- Put `PasswrodStrength.exe` and all DLLs in the same folder and call `.\PasswordStrength.exe` in PS to run the application on Windows.
